                    <p>Budapest is all about water—the broad Danube that divides the city, the bubbling hot thermal waters that fill the many bath houses. 
                        Sure, the Szechenyi Baths may have the most extravagant architecture and an outdoor pool surrounded by classical statuary, 
                        but to avoid the stag parties, try the 16th century Ottoman thermal pool at the Rudas Baths.</p>

                    <h4>Attend a festival</h4>
                    <p>Budapest has a wide variety of festivals and cultural events over the summer. The best known is the vast, six-day Sziget music festival 
                        that takes over Óbuda Island in the Danube in early August, and features literally hundreds of the best names in contemporary music, 
                        as well as tons of dance, theater, circus, and other entertainment.</p>

                    <h4>Go to an open-air event</h4>
                    <p>The most spectacular outdoor show of the year is the fireworks display for St. Stephen’s Day on September 20, when Hungary celebrates 
                        the foundation of Hungary in 1000. Fireworks are launched from seven barges, 65 pontoons, and two bridges along nearly three miles 
                        of the Danube, with light projections and drone illuminations, making this one of the world’s most impressive free shows.</p>
